# Project Brief: DRO (Datum Research Observatory)

## Overview

DRO is a minimalist Progressive Web App (PWA) that serves as a Lua IDE for generating and visualizing spectral lookup tables (Datum). The application features a distinctive retro-terminal UI with Fira Mono font and amber theme.

## Core Purpose

- Provide a lightweight, cross-platform Lua scripting environment
- Generate spectral lookup tables through Lua programming
- Visualize 20-band spectral data in real-time
- Offer a unique retro-terminal aesthetic experience

## Key Features

- **Lua IDE**: CodeMirror-based editor with syntax highlighting
- **Real-time Execution**: Wasmoon WebAssembly Lua runtime
- **Data Visualization**: uPlot-based 2D graphs for spectral data
- **Retro Aesthetic**: Dark background, Fira Mono font, amber accents
- **PWA Capabilities**: Installable, offline-capable web application
- **Persistence**: localStorage for scripts and settings

## Target Users

- Audio developers working with spectral data
- Researchers experimenting with lookup table generation
- Developers who appreciate minimalist, terminal-inspired interfaces
- Anyone needing a lightweight Lua prototyping environment

## Success Criteria

- Fast, responsive Lua code execution
- Clean, minimal terminal-inspired UI
- Smooth real-time visualization updates
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Installable as native-like PWA
