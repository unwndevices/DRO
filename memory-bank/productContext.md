# Product Context: DROP(Datum Research Open Platform)

## Why DROPExists

### Problem Statement

Current tools for spectral lookup table generation are either:

- Heavy desktop applications with complex interfaces
- Command-line tools lacking visualization
- Cloud-based solutions requiring internet connectivity
- Expensive commercial software with unnecessary features

### Solution Approach

DROPprovides a focused, lightweight solution that combines:

- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time visualization as code changes
- **Minimal Friction**: Web-based, no installation required
- **Visual Clarity**: Retro-terminal aesthetic reduces visual noise
- **Portability**: Works across all modern devices and platforms

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Workflow

1. **Write Lua Code**: Clean editor with syntax highlighting
2. **Execute Instantly**: Fast WASM-based Lua runtime
3. **Visualize Results**: Real-time 20-band spectral display
4. **Iterate Quickly**: Immediate feedback loop
5. **Save & Share**: Persistent storage and easy sharing

### Aesthetic Philosophy

- **Minimal Distraction**: Dark background, single accent color
- **Professional Feel**: Monospace typography, clean lines
- **Nostalgic Charm**: Terminal-inspired without being gimmicky
- **Functional Beauty**: Every visual element serves a purpose

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases

- **Spectral Filter Development**: Creating custom filter bank coefficients
- **Audio Effect Prototyping**: Rapid testing of spectral processing ideas
- **Educational Purposes**: Learning spectral analysis concepts
- **Research Applications**: Experimenting with novel spectral transforms

### Secondary Use Cases

- **General Lua Prototyping**: Quick scripting environment
- **Data Visualization**: Simple 2D plotting for any numerical data
- **Algorithm Testing**: Fast iteration on mathematical concepts

## Success Metrics

- Time from idea to visualization < 30 seconds
- Zero-friction startup (no downloads, installs, or accounts)
- Consistent 60fps visualization during playback
- Cross-platform visual consistency
